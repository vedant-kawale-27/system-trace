/**
 * Lightweight i18n scaffolding.
 *
 * This is intentionally small: a flat key->string catalog per language and a
 * `t(key, fallback)` lookup. The app ships English today; other languages are
 * community-contributed by adding a catalog below and a `LANGUAGES` entry.
 *
 * Components call `t("some.key", "English fallback")`. If the active language
 * has no entry for the key, the English fallback is shown - so the UI is never
 * blank even when a translation is incomplete. Full migration of every hard
 * coded string into keys is tracked as a follow-up issue.
